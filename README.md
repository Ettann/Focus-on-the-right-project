# Focus-on-the-right-project
To help organizations to focus on the right projects according to strategy
# Project Title
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
From a large amount of project ideas, help organizaions to select the right projects and therefor create best business in the long run.

## Background
Too many projects are started and not finished in many organisations. Lack of coordination, lack of knowledge of what other departments are doing, lack of priority rules, lack of understanding of set strategies and an eager to start projects without understanding the effects are some of the reasons of poor results. 
Focusing on the right projects accordning to set strategy will create a healthier organisation, a better focus, faster deliveries and better business.

## How is it used?
Code: 
*1 Relevant strategies translated into rules
*2 Interdependancies between strategies are clear and coded
*3 Priority rules are set in detail
*4 Definitions of rules for small, medium and large projects are set

Input: Project ideas with clear measurable goals and effects throughout the organisation and desirable long-term effects for business. All based on set rules.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data input comes from the organisation. 

## Challenges
To set the rules for AI to acknowledge. 

## What next?
To find an organisation interested in testing a AI solution for this challenge. 
To base the test on facts and interviews on how the situation is today, a so called zero measurement. 
We need some skilled AI developers as well.
